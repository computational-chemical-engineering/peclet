# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`suite/` is a workspace holding **six independent projects** for GPU-accelerated and parallel scientific computing — particle dynamics, CFD, and the spatial-indexing primitives they build on. There is **no top-level build, test runner, or git repository**: each subdirectory is its own self-contained repo with its own `CMakeLists.txt`, build system, and (in two cases) its own `CLAUDE.md`. Work happens *inside* a subproject, not at this level.

**Consequence for any task:** `cd` into the relevant subproject before building, testing, or running git. A `git status` / commit / diff issued from `suite/` itself will fail or hit the wrong repo. The subprojects are not git submodules of a parent — they are siblings that happen to share a folder.

## Direction of the suite (read before cross-cutting work)

The codes are being given a shared foundation while staying separate method codes: one MPI **block
decomposition** with efficient **asynchronous ghost-layer exchange**, common **SDF** solids and
**IBM**, **GPU** support, and **Python bindings** everywhere. The reusable parts of `block_decomposer`
have been extracted into a new shared **`transport-core/`** library (header-only C++20, its own git
repo + `CLAUDE.md`) that every method will depend on.

**`transport-core/` status:** complete and tested (26 ctests, `mpirun -np 1..8`). Provides ORB block
decomposition; the async grid ghost-layer exchange (`tpx::halo::GridHalo` — topology/exchange split,
field-agnostic, NBX + persistent neighborhood-collective engines, overlap-capable, plus a GPU-resident
host-staged variant); the Lagrangian halo (`tpx::halo::ParticleMigrator` — particle migration +
`gatherGhosts`); and SDF geometry with scalar/vector VTI I/O. See `transport-core/CLAUDE.md`.

**Consumers:** `cfd-gpu` has a **complete, validated distributed Navier–Stokes solver** on the core
(branch `mpi-halo-integration`, opt-in `-DCFD_BUILD_MPI=ON`, 37 ctests real multi-rank, a runnable
VTI-writing demo; production `pnm_backend` untouched — see `cfd-gpu/doc/mpi_parallelization_status.md`).
`packing-gpu` (Lagrangian) has its migration + ghost-particle primitives validated on its real `float4`
layout (branch `mpi-integration`, `packing-gpu/mpi/`). The remaining big pieces are the in-place
solver integrations (cfd's multigrid + global reductions; packing's per-step loop) — see
[docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).

The design contract lives in `docs/`:

- [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — layering, dependency graph, Lagrangian/Eulerian/mixed taxonomy, how each code maps onto the core.
- [docs/CONVENTIONS.md](docs/CONVENTIONS.md) — SDF sign, x-fastest indexing, types, precision policy, periodic/Lees–Edwards, Python array shapes.
- [docs/STYLE.md](docs/STYLE.md) — C++20 host / C++17 device, clang-format/tidy (from voronoi), namespaces, CMake/CI.
- [docs/INTERFACES.md](docs/INTERFACES.md) — shared C++20 concepts: `Domain`, `Decomposition`, `Field`, `HaloExchange`, `SdfGeometry`, `ImmersedBoundary`, `Stepper`.
- [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) — phased plan; the near-term work is the decomposition + async halo engine.

## The projects

| Directory | Language / stack | What it does | Has own CLAUDE.md |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `transport-core/` | Header-only C++20 + MPI | **Shared infrastructure** (new): ORB block decomposition + asynchronous ghost-layer exchange (NBX + persistent engines) + particle migration. The layer every method code will depend on. Tested (13/13, np 1–8). | **Yes — read it** |
| `morton_arithmetic/` | Header-only C++17 (+ CUDA, Python) | Morton/Z-order codes with **arithmetic in Morton space** (neighbour-find, axis add, Z-order step without decode→re-encode). BMI2/AVX-512 + runtime dispatch; the foundational spatial-index library. | **Yes — read it** |
| `cfd-gpu/` | CUDA + C++17 + pybind11 (`pnm_backend`) | GPU incompressible Navier–Stokes solver for porous media: staggered MAC grid, Immersed Boundary Method over SDF geometry, pressure projection. | **Yes — read it** |
| `packing-gpu/` | CUDA + C++17 + pybind11 (`demgpu`) | GPU Discrete Element Method (DEM): XPBD solver + SDF point-shell collision for dense particle packing. Optional MPI. README still calls it `dem-gpu`. | No |
| `voronoi_dynamics/` | Header-only C++17 (+ OpenMP, Boost, Voro++) | Dynamic 3D Voronoi tessellation of moving particles; periodic & Lees–Edwards boxes, incremental cell repair, Euler/NS/multiphase dynamics. | No |
| `block_decomposer/` | C++20 + MPI + Boost + GTest | Recursive block domain decomposition (`pbs::BlockDecomposer<Dim>`) and an ADI solver for distributed-memory grids. Executables, not a library. | No |

Common threads worth knowing when moving between them: SDFs (signed distance fields) are the shared geometry representation across `cfd-gpu` and `packing-gpu`; VTI/VTP files (ParaView/Ovito) are the shared I/O format; periodic boundary conditions appear everywhere; and most numeric projects pin CUDA to a specific arch (e.g. `sm_90`/`native`) for the dev box's RTX 5080.

## Per-project quick reference

For `morton_arithmetic` and `cfd-gpu`, **defer to their own `CLAUDE.md`** — the entries below are only an entry point.

### morton_arithmetic
```bash
cd morton_arithmetic
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
./build/tests/morton_tests --test-case="<name>"     # single doctest case
```
The non-BMI2 build is contractually PDEP/PEXT-free (a test greps the binary). AVX-512 batch kernels have no local hardware — validate under Intel SDE (`sde64 -skx -- ./build/tests/morton_tests`). See its CLAUDE.md for the runtime-dispatch and wheel-build subtleties.

### cfd-gpu
```bash
cd cfd-gpu
mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build .   # -> build/pnm_backend.so
cd .. && source .venv/bin/activate
python tests/test_cfd_solver.py
python scripts/verify_poiseuille.py                          # analytical-solution check
```

### packing-gpu
```bash
cd packing-gpu
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install pybind11 numpy
cmake -B build -S . -DDEMGPU_ENABLE_MPI=OFF                  # MPI is scaffolding only
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)                               # -> build/demgpu.cpython-*.so
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/build
python verify_packing_hollow_cylinders.py                    # verify_*.py are the test/demo entry points
```
The many root-level `verify_*.py` / `test_*.py` / `plan_*.md` / `build_log*.txt` files are this project's working scratch — verification scripts and design notes, not a packaged test suite.

### voronoi_dynamics
```bash
cd voronoi_dynamics
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release        # FetchContent pulls Voro++ automatically
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build -R "test_static_voronoi|test_voro_comparison" --output-on-failure
clang-format --dry-run --Werror include/voronoi_dynamics/*.hpp tests/*.cpp   # Google style, enforced
```
Header-only: consumers just add `include/`. Voronoi cells are stored as a half-edge mesh with a packed `makeLabel(facet,vertex,edge)` integer encoding (see README "Data structure overview").

### block_decomposer
```bash
cd block_decomposer
cmake -B build -S . && cmake --build build        # needs MPI, Boost>=1.65, GTest
mpirun -np <N> ./build/src/translate_periodic      # MPI executables live in build/src/
```
Core code is header-only templates in `src/*.hpp` (namespace `pbs`); `main.cpp`, `main_ADI.cpp`, `translate_periodic.cpp` are the drivers. The GTest target is currently commented out in `src/CMakeLists.txt`.

## Conventions across the suite

- **CUDA C++ projects** pair `.cu`/`.cuh` kernels with a pybind11 binding TU and expose the simulation as an importable Python module; drive simulations from Python, not C++ mains.
- **Header-only C++ projects** (`morton_arithmetic`, `voronoi_dynamics`, and `block_decomposer`'s core) put the real logic in templates under `include/` or `src/*.hpp`; there is no library to link.
- Build artifacts (`build/`, `build_*/`, `.venv/`, `*.so`, `__pycache__/`) and large output assets (`*.vti`, `*.vtp`, `*.png`) are committed/present in several projects — don't treat their existence as something you created, and prefer the project's own out-of-source `build/` directory.
- Two projects carry `AGENTS.md`/`GEMINI.md` alongside `CLAUDE.md` (cfd-gpu); when editing guidance, the CLAUDE.md is the one that governs Claude Code.
